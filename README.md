# Mission Control

A real-time, high-performance dashboard for managing autonomous agents and complex task queues. Built with **Convex**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, Mission Control provides a "Command Center" experience for monitoring and orchestrating operations.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Real-time Synchronization**: Powered by Convex, every change (task moves, agent updates, comments, document creation) propagates instantly to all connected clients.
- 🤖 **Agent Oversight**: Monitor the status and activity of your agent roster in real-time, with live counts in the header.
- 📦 **Mission Queue**: A kanban-style overview of tasks categorized by status: Inbox, Assigned, In Progress, Review, and Done, with selection-driven detail views.
- 🧭 **Task Detail Panel**: Inspect and edit task status, descriptions, and assignees, plus quick actions like “Mark as Done” and task ID copy.
- 🧾 **Resources & Deliverables**: Task-linked documents show up as structured resources with type and path metadata.
- 💬 **Comments & Activity**: Comment tracking and a live activity feed with filters for tasks, comments, docs, and status updates.
- 🔐 **Secure Access**: Integrated Convex Auth for secure terminal login and management.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Premium, centered layout that works seamlessly across all devices.
- 🔗 **OpenClaw Integration**: Automatic task tracking for OpenClaw agent runs with real-time progress updates.
- 🔐 **Hosted Tokens**: Generate and rotate API tokens in the Settings sidebar for multi-user hosted deployments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup
Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development environment:

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

### 2. Seeding Data
To populate your local dashboard with the initial roster of agents and tasks, run the seed script:

```bash
npx convex run seed:run
```

### 3. Terminal Access
1. Open the app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
2. Use the **Sign Up** flow to create your commander credentials.
3. Access the dashboard to start monitoring operations.

## 🔗 OpenClaw Integration

Mission Control integrates with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw) to automatically track agent tasks in real-time.

### How It Works

```
OpenClaw Agent → Lifecycle Events → Hook Handler → HTTP POST → Convex → Real-time UI
```

When an OpenClaw agent runs:
1. **Task Created** - A new task appears in the "In Progress" column with the user's prompt as the title
2. **Progress Updates** - Tool usage and thinking events appear as comments
3. **Completion** - Task moves to "Done" with duration displayed (e.g., "Completed in 2m 15s")
4. **Errors** - Task moves to "Review" column with error details

### Setup

#### 1. Install the Mission Control Hook

Copy the hook to your OpenClaw hooks directory:

```bash
cp -r ~/.openclaw/hooks/mission-control ~/.openclaw/hooks/
```

Or create it manually at `~/.openclaw/hooks/mission-control/handler.ts`.

#### 2. Configure the Webhook URL

Add the Mission Control URL to your OpenClaw config (`~/.openclaw/config.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "mission-control": {
          "enabled": true,
          "env": {
            "MISSION_CONTROL_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:3211/openclaw/event",
            "MISSION_CONTROL_TOKEN": "mc_live_..."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For production, use your Convex deployment URL:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "internal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": {
        "mission-control": {
          "enabled": true,
          "env": {
            "MISSION_CONTROL_URL": "https://your-project.convex.site/openclaw/event",
            "MISSION_CONTROL_TOKEN": "mc_live_..."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or set the environment variables:

```bash
export MISSION_CONTROL_URL="https://your-project.convex.site/openclaw/event"
export MISSION_CONTROL_TOKEN="mc_live_..."
```

If you host Mission Control and want to require tokens, set:

```bash
export MISSION_CONTROL_AUTH_REQUIRED=true
```

Local/self-host remains compatible when this flag is not set.

#### 3. Restart OpenClaw Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

### Optional: Configure Hook URL for Settings UI

To show the correct webhook URL in the Settings sidebar, set:

```bash
export VITE_MISSION_CONTROL_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-project.convex.site/openclaw/event"
```

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Capture** | User prompts become task titles and descriptions |
| **Duration Tracking** | Shows how long each agent run took |
| **Source Detection** | Messages from Telegram, Discord, etc. show source prefix |
| **Markdown Comments** | Progress updates render with full markdown support |
| **Agent Matching** | OpenClaw agents map to Mission Control agents by name |

### Webhook Endpoint

The integration receives events at:

```
POST /openclaw/event
```

Payload format:
```json
{
  "runId": "unique-run-id",
  "action": "start" | "end" | "error" | "progress",
  "sessionKey": "session-key",
  "prompt": "user prompt text",
  "source": "Telegram",
  "response": "agent response",
  "error": "error message"
}
```

When auth is enabled, include:

```
Authorization: Bearer <MISSION_CONTROL_TOKEN>
```
